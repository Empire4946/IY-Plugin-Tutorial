# IY-Plugin-Tutorial
A tutorial on how to make Plugins for Infinite Yield.

# Rules
Obfuscated plugins are not allowed, as such will be treated as malware. Additionally, plugins ***ARE REQUIRED*** in ***BOLD TEXT*** to specifically state if they are using a loadstring inside of it, what is being loaded, and from where. 

If you have any http(s) requests that come from external sources (ex. not roblox.com) those should be stated too

# Types of IY Plugins ( i gues )
1. AutoExecute (When you add the plugin it executes code without typing the command)
2. Normal (comes with commands)


# IY discord
